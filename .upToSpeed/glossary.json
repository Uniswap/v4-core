It typically involves using Uniswap's flash swap feature to borrow assets without upfront capital, trading them on another platform at a more favorable price, and then returning the borrowed assets to Uniswap with a fee. This mechanism helps align prices across different markets and maintains Uniswap's price equilibrium. For example, if 1 ETH costs 200 DAI on Uniswap but can be sold for 220 DAI elsewhere, an arbitrageur can profit 20 DAI (minus fees) through this process.

When the market price is within a position's range, that liquidity is active and earns trading fees. If the price moves outside the range, the liquidity becomes inactive until the price returns. This system allows for more efficient market making, potentially higher returns for liquidity providers, and better pricing for traders, especially in stable or range-bound markets.\nKey aspects of concentrated liquidity include:\n1. Custom price ranges for liquidity provision\n2. Tick-based price space partitioning\n3. Active and inactive liquidity states\n4. Improved capital efficiency\n5. Potential for higher fee generation\n6. Enablement of range orders (similar to limit orders)\n```solidity\n// Example from src/libraries/Pool.sol\nstruct ModifyLiquidityState {\n    bool flippedLower;\n    uint128 liquidityGrossAfterLower;\n    bool flippedUpper;\n    uint128 liquidityGrossAfterUpper;\n}\n```\nThis struct demonstrates how the protocol tracks changes in liquidity at specific price points (ticks), which is fundamental to the concentrated liquidity mechanism."

Expressed as x * y = k, where x and y represent the reserves of two tokens in a liquidity pool and k is a constant, this formula ensures that the product of the reserves remains unchanged during trades. It determines how prices are calculated and trades are executed, maintaining a balance between liquidity and price impact. As trades occur, the formula adjusts token quantities to preserve the constant k, allowing for permissionless, decentralized trading while providing liquidity providers with a share of trading fees.\nKey aspects:\n1. Automated price discovery based on current reserves\n2. Ensures liquidity for all trade sizes, with larger trades experiencing higher price impact\n3. Enables passive market making for liquidity providers\n4.

This invariant maintains the balance between token reserves and determines the exchange rate, allowing for efficient and predictable trading while preserving liquidity.\nKey aspects of the invariant:\n1. Constant product: The product of token reserves remains unchanged after trades.\n2. Price determination: The ratio of reserves dictates the current exchange rate.\n3. Slippage mechanism: Larger trades cause more significant price impacts, protecting the pool from manipulation.\n4.
