It calculates the amount paid, updates internal accounting with a positive delta, and resets the synced currency.\n\nThese functions optimize gas usage by batching transfers and using internal accounting. For example, in a multi-hop trade, you can 'take' from multiple pools and 'settle' only once at the end, reducing overall gas costs and simplifying complex operations.\n\nThe `_settle` function handles the core settlement logic, supporting both native and ERC20 tokens.",
