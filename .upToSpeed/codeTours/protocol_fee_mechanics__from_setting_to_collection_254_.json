Each currency (token) used in the pools has its own entry in this mapping. When fees are collected during swaps or other operations, the corresponding amount is added to the currency's entry in this mapping. This allows for accurate accounting of fees across different tokens and enables the protocol to later distribute or utilize these fees as needed.","title":"","id":"2650"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The protocolFeeController is an external contract that plays a crucial role in determining protocol fees.

By externalizing the fee control logic, Uniswap v4 can implement complex fee strategies that can be updated without changing the core protocol. This controller can set different fees for different pools, adjust fees based on market conditions, or implement any other custom fee logic. This flexibility is a significant improvement over static fee structures.","title":"","id":"2652"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The setProtocolFee function allows the protocol fee controller to set fees for specific pools.

Only the protocolFeeController can call this function, ensuring that fee changes are controlled and intentional. The function includes important checks: it verifies the caller's identity and ensures the new fee is within valid bounds. This helps prevent unauthorized fee changes and keeps fees within reasonable limits. After setting the new fee, an event is emitted to provide transparency about fee changes. This function allows the protocol to adjust fees dynamically in response to market conditions or governance decisions.","title":"","id":"2654"},{"type":"textOnly","description":"The protocolFeeController is a crucial component of Uniswap v4's fee management system.

Fee Update: The _updateProtocolFees function is called to update the total accrued fees for the specific currency.\n\nExample: If a swap involves 1000 tokens and the protocol fee is 0.1% (10 basis points), the fee would be 1 token.
