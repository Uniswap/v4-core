Before the swap (line 203): The beforeSwap hook is called, allowing for custom logic such as access control, fee adjustment, or trade validation.\n\n2. Executing the swap (lines 207-218): The actual swap occurs, using any modifications from the beforeSwap hook.\n\n3. After the swap (line 222): The afterSwap hook is called, enabling post-swap actions like logging, analytics, or additional balance adjustments.\n\n4. Hook delta accounting (lines 224-225): Any balance changes from the hooks are accounted for, ensuring the pool's state remains consistent.\n\nThis structure allows developers to inject custom behavior at critical points in the swap process, enabling advanced features like dynamic fees, conditional execution, or complex trading strategies. The hooks system's flexibility is a key innovation in Uniswap v4, opening up new possibilities for DeFi applications.",
