This tour will guide you through:\n\n1. The new singleton PoolManager architecture\n2. The extensible hooks system\n3. Core pool operations and liquidity management\n4. Native ETH support\n5. Protocol fee mechanisms\n\nEach of these areas introduces new potential security considerations. Throughout this tour, we'll examine how these components interact and their impact on the protocol's overall security posture. Let's begin by exploring the fundamental changes in v4's architecture.",

This design significantly reduces deployment costs and simplifies pool management.\n\nKey features for auditors to note:\n1. Flash accounting: The PoolManager uses a unique system to track token balances during a transaction, allowing for complex multi-step operations.\n2. Hooks integration: The contract interacts with customizable hooks, which can introduce additional complexity and potential vulnerabilities.\n3. Fee management: It handles both LP and protocol fees, requiring careful auditing of fee calculations and distributions.\n\nAs an auditor, focus on the interactions between these components, especially around state management and security implications of the singleton design.",

Hooks allow customizable pool functionality, enabling features like dynamic fees and oracles. However, they also present potential attack vectors.\n\nAs an auditor, pay close attention to:\n1. Hook deployment addresses: The least significant bits determine which hooks are active.\n2. Access control: Only the PoolManager should call these functions.\n3. Return values: Hooks must return specific function selectors.\n4. Potential for malicious hooks: Custom hooks could manipulate pool behavior.\n\nThe IHooks interface defines these customizable actions.

Singleton Architecture (PoolManager):\n   - Assess centralization risks and potential single points of failure.\n   - Evaluate gas efficiency claims and their security implications.\n\n2. Hook System:\n   - Scrutinize the hook validation process in PoolManager.\n   - Analyze potential vulnerabilities in hook interactions, especially re-entrancy risks.\n\n3. Pool Library:\n   - Thoroughly review swap and liquidity provision logic for edge cases.\n   - Verify correct implementation of mathematical operations, especially in SqrtPriceMath.\n\n4. Native ETH Handling:\n   - Examine the Currency type implementation for potential vulnerabilities.\n   - Verify correct ETH balance tracking and transfer mechanisms.\n\n5. Protocol Fee Management:\n   - Review access controls and fee setting mechanisms in ProtocolFees contract.\n   - Assess the security of fee accrual and withdrawal processes.\n\nKey Interactions to Audit:\n- PoolManager's interaction with hooks during various operations.\n- Currency conversions between ETH and ERC20 tokens in swap operations.\n- Fee calculations and distributions across PoolManager, Pool, and ProtocolFees.\n\nPrioritize your audit on the core PoolManager contract and its interactions with other components. Pay special attention to state changes and ensure all paths are properly access-controlled.\n\nRemember, this overview is a starting point. Dive deeper into each component, and don't hesitate to question any assumptions or implementations you encounter.",
