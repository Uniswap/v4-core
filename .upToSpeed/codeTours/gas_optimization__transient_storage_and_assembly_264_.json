It provides temporary storage that only persists for the duration of a transaction. This makes it significantly cheaper than regular storage operations, as the data doesn't need to be persisted in the blockchain state. Transient storage is particularly useful for temporary values that are only needed within a single transaction, such as lock states or intermediate calculation results.",

They use inline assembly with `tstore` and `tload` operations to manipulate a transient storage slot. The `IS_UNLOCKED_SLOT` is a constant representing the storage slot used for the lock state. The `tstore` operation in `unlock()` and `lock()` sets the state, while `tload` in `isUnlocked()` retrieves it. This approach is more gas-efficient than using regular storage operations because the data doesn't persist beyond the current transaction.",

Standard Solidity: `revert CustomError()`\n2.

Transient storage, inline assembly, and unchecked math operations significantly reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, crucial for a high-volume DEX like Uniswap. In the broader ecosystem, these optimizations enable more complex operations within gas limits, facilitating advanced features like hooks and dynamic fees. However, their implementation requires a delicate balance between efficiency and security. Developers must carefully audit and test contracts using these techniques to prevent vulnerabilities. When properly implemented, these optimizations contribute to Uniswap v4's competitive edge in the DeFi landscape, offering users faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining robust security measures.",
