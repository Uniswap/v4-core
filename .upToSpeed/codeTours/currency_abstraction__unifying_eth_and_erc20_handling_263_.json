It allows for uniform treatment of all currency pairs, whether they involve ETH, ERC20 tokens, or a combination.\n\nNotably, this approach handles edge cases seamlessly. For instance, when creating a pool with ETH, the Currency type (being address(0)) requires no special treatment, unlike traditional implementations that might need separate ETH wrapper contracts.\n\nThis uniformity extends to other parts of the protocol, streamlining operations like swaps, liquidity provision, and fee calculations across all currency types.
