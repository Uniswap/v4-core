The use of transient storage significantly reduces gas costs, a critical factor in Uniswap's efficiency.\n\nUnderstanding this library is essential for grasping how Uniswap v4 maintains up-to-date balance information throughout complex trading operations.",

The increment and decrement functions update the count of non-zero balances:\n\n- increment(): Called when an address goes from zero to non-zero balance.\n- decrement(): Called when an address goes from non-zero to zero balance.\n\nBy maintaining this count, the protocol can quickly check if all balances are settled, preventing scenarios where unsettled balances could lead to inconsistencies or locked funds.
