# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to try out UpToSpeed. 
A tool that helps you onboard and learn codebases up to 100% faster. 

# Getting started

### 0. Accept "Do you want to install the recommended 'UpToSpeed' extension..."
*(if you accidentally closed, refresh window or manually install the extension 'uptospeed')*

### 1. Open the Plugin
Click the UpToSpeed logo ‚è© (fastforward button) in the top right corner of this window(active editor).

Or Command pallet:
Mac: `cmd+shift+p` 
Other: `ctrl+shift+p` 

then type "Start UpToSpeed" and press enter.

### 2. Take your first tour
Now on the right you should see the UpToSpeed plugin.
Click one of the buttons with a tour name on it to start a tour. 

### 3. Enjoy!

### Extra
Hotkeys for back and forth. 

Next step: `cmd+shift+l` / `ctrl+shift+l` (space instead of l also works)
Prev step: `cmd+shift+h` / `ctrl+shift+h`

UpToSpeed looks better in Dark Mode. If you're in Light Mode, press `Cmd+shift+p` or `Ctl+shift+p` and run the the "Toggle Between Light/Dark Themes" command.
