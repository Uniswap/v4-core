# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to v4 of the Uniswap Protocol! The contracts in this repo are in early stages - we are releasing the draft code now so that v4 can be built in public, with open feedback and meaningful community contribution. We expect this will be a months-long process, and we appreciate any kind of contribution, no matter how small.

If you need to get in contact with the repository maintainers, please reach out in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCfyBSbCU5).

## Types of Contributing

There are many ways to contribute, but here are a few if you want a place to start:

1. **Opening an issue.** Before opening an issue, please check that there is not an issue already open. If there is, feel free to comment more details, explanations, or examples within the open issue rather than duplicating it. Suggesting changes to the open development process are within the bounds of opening issues. We are always open to feedback and receptive to suggestions!
2. **Resolving an issue.** You can resolve an issue either by showing that it is not an issue or by fixing the issue with code changes, additional tests, etc. Any pull request fixing an issue should reference that issue.
3. **Reviewing open PRs.** You can provide comments, standards guidance, naming suggestions, gas optimizations, or ideas for alternative designs on any open pull request.

## Opening an Issue

When opening an [issue](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/issues/new/choose), choose a template to start from: Bug Report or Feature Improvement. For bug reports, you should be able to reproduce the bug through tests or proof of concept implementations. For feature improvements, please title it with a concise problem statement and check that a similar request is not already open or already in progress. Not all issues may be deemed worth resolving, so please follow through with responding to any questions or comments that others may have regarding the issue.

Feel free to tag the issue as a “good first issue” for any clean-up related issues, or small scoped changes to help encourage pull requests from first time contributors!

## Opening a Pull Request

All pull requests should be opened against the `main` branch.  In the pull request, please reference the issue you are fixing.

Pull requests can be reviewed by community members, but to be merged they will need approval from the repository maintainers. Please understand it will take time to receive a response, although the maintainers will aim to respond and comment as soon as possible.

**For larger, more substantial changes to the code, it is best to open an issue and start a discussion with the maintainers to align on the change before spending time on the development.**

Finally, before opening a pull request please do the following:

- Check that the code style follows the [standards](#standards).
- Run the tests and snapshots. Commands are outlined in the [tests](#tests) section.
- Document any new functions, structs, or interfaces following the natspec standard.
- Add tests! For smaller contributions, they should be tested with unit tests, and fuzz tests where possible. For bigger contributions, they should be tested with integration tests and invariant tests where possible.
- Make sure all commits are [signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) 

## Standards

All contributions must follow the below standards. Maintainers will close out PRs that do not adhere to these standards.

1. All contracts should be formatted with the default forge fmt config. Run `forge fmt`.
2. These contracts follow the [solidity style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html) with one minor exception of using the _prependUnderscore style naming for internal contract functions, internal top-level parameters, and function parameters with naming collisions.
3. All external facing contracts should inherit from interfaces, which specify and document its functions with natspec.
4. Picking up stale issues by other authors is fine! Please just communicate with them ahead of time and it is best practice to include co-authors in any commits.
5. Squash commits where possible to make reviews clean and efficient. PRs that are merged to main will be squashed into 1 commit.

## Tests

This repo currently uses hardhat and forge tests. Please run both test suites before opening a PR.

`yarn snapshots` to update the hardhat gas snapshots

`yarn test` to run hardhat tests

`yarn prettier` to run the formatter (runs both typescript and solidity formatting)

`forge snapshot`to update the forge gas snapshots

`forge test` to run forge tests

Any new tests that you add should be written with forge, as the repo is undergoing a full migration to the forge test suite.

## Code of Conduct

Above all else, please be respectful of the people behind the code. Any kind of aggressive or disrespectful comments, issues, and language will be removed.

Issues and PRs that are obviously spam and unhelpful to the development process or unrelated to the core code will also be closed.
